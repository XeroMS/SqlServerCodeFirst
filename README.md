## Credits ##

I must give credit where credit is due.

Thank you to everyone that published the amazing open source platform [MVCForum](https://github.com/YodasMyDad/mvcforum) that most of this was developed from.

Thank you to Microsoft for their Dependency Injection Framework because the Dependency Injection Project is just a slimmed down version of their Dependency Injection Framework so that a dependency on System.Web is not needed.

Thank you to Brouznouf over at [FiveM.net](https://forum.fivem.net) for creating MySQL Async and giving me a base to start from to ultimately get this working.

Thank you to everyone over at [FiveM.net](https://forum.fivem.net) that helped me and pushed me to get this working.
